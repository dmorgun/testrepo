Staging Area:
A place where we can group files together before we "commit" them to Git.

Commit
A "commit" is a snapshot of our repository. This way if we ever need to look back at the changes we've made (or if someone else does), we will see a nice timeline of all changes.

Wildcards:
We need quotes so that Git will receive the wildcard before our shell can interfere with it. Without quotes our shell will only execute the wildcard search within the current directory. Git will receive the list of files the shell found instead of the wildcard and it will not be able to add the files inside of the octofamily directory.

Check all the things!
When using wildcards you want to be extra careful when doing commits. Make sure to check what files and folders are staged by using git status before you do the actual commit. This way you can be sure you're committing only the things you want.
